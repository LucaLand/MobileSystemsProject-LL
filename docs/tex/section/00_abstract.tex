\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we propose a small project for the \textit{\href{https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2021/402283}{Mobile Systems}} course.
The project basically consists of a small robot that is piloted by a mobile device: the user sets a destination and then follows the robot that takes him to the desired location.

\textbf{We underline that this work is only a very simplified description of the main operation of the system} that can be extended in future developments.
In this work we only develop e very simple system that shows the basic idea of this project without covering all the aspects of a real \textit{sealable} product, but only those related with the contents of the \textit{Mobile Systems} course with some elements derived by the course of \href{https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2021/468003}{\textit{Ingegneria dei Sistemi Software}}.
