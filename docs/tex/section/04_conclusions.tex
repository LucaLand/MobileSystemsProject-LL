\section{Conclusions}

After some experimental tests with a \textit{mBot}\footnote{A robot piloted by \texttt{Arduino} with a \texttt{Raspberry} installed over it.}, we can say that \textit{the core of the system is realized} satisfying most of the contents of the \textit{Mobile Systems} course.

However, there are some critical limitation that make the system not yet usable:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the location could be affected by some errors that make the robot mistake;
	\item the \texttt{RSSI} calculated from \texttt{GATT} may be too imprecise;
	\item the robot does not realize what the walkable road is.
\end{enumerate}

			In order to resolve these strong limitations, probably the contents of the \textit{Mobile Systems} and \textit{Ingegneria dei Sistemi Software} courses are not sufficient: it is needed to introduce elements from \textit{Artificial Intelligence} and \textit{Intelligent System}.
